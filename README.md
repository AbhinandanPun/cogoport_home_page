1.    Branch in GitHub</br> 
        main: host the code of the initial attempt to replicate the cogoport website. I have missed the laptop part there. The difficulties faced are mentioned in the 2nd point.</br>https://github.com/AbhinandanPun/cogoport_home_page/tree/main</br></br>  
        feature/responsive-success:  This branch has a very close copy of the responsive cogoport home page. Please Evaluate this branch for checking responsiveness. Only added a laptop and one other section on the day of           submission.</br>

2. Faced difficulty in these sections:</br>
        The header section: To manipulate two video sources on the media query. I learnt it by many trial and error.</br></br>  
          The PRODUCTS SECTION: It had the most challenging CSS in my pov.  To align-items:flex-start was not working for the div-cards under products-category. I was stuck there. Especially to name many different CSS                 classes and manage them.</br></br>  
MAJOR LEARNING The RESPONSIVE-WIDTH of the webpage: My webpage failed to acquire the entire width of dimensions on the web page emulator. I am still figuring it out. We have to work around with screen and the max-width is generally set to 767 px.</br> </br> 
The NAVIGATION BAR DROPDOWN (   三    ): I Figured out to toggle the three-bar symbol to open the menu and vice-versa. But I am facing difficulty positioning it in the right place.
GENERALLY, I faced hardship in positioning the elements using flex and grid for display.</br> </br> 
MARQUEE was challenging, but I figured it out from a resource. I had to add a few lines of code this https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/css-marquee/.</br> </br> 
THE ARC: I figured we have to use two divs with different colours, stack on each other with one having border-radius on the bottom side.</br> </br> 
THE LAPTOP: It was very difficult to do. My implementation of the laptop section was making other sections go out of position or style. So I removed it in the “main” and added in “feature/responsive-success”.</br> </br>
